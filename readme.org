* Python OpenCV

  [[../../actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg]]

  A simple opencv project in python that performs the following processes to an image:

  - grayscale
  - threshold
  - denoise
  - dilate
  - erode
  - canny edge detection

  These are steps that are found common in OCR preprocessing apps, a relatively simple field to showcase opencv.

* Setup

  Setup the environment: 

  #+begin_src sh
    poetry env use 3.9.8
  #+end_src

* Install

  #+begin_src sh
    poetry install
  #+end_src

* Testing
  
  To run the unit tests:  

  #+begin_src sh
    poetry run pytest --cov tests
  #+end_src


* Run

  The example application performs OCR preprocessing.
  The usage of this app is: `python python_opencv <input> <output>`.

  #+begin_src sh
    poetry run python python_opencv assets/gameboy.jpg output.jpg
  #+end_src
